# Source Slicer

It's like [Tant≈ç](https://github.com/Vector35/tanto), but for source code.

The goal is to lean towards this being actually useful more than formally correct.

## Architecture

The main slicing code is written in Rust and uses tree-sitter for code parsing.
Various IDE plugins (vscode, vim, etc.) can call into the Rust binary easily to get the slice results.
